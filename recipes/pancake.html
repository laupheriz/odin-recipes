        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat
                together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted <br> butter in a separate bowl. Keep the 
                two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick 
                water across the surface and if it beads up <br>and sizzles, it's ready. 
            </li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix 
                until it's just blended together. The batter will  <br>be a little lumpy which is what
                you want.
            </li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 
                cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear <br>on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes
                flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with
                remaining batter.

            </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
